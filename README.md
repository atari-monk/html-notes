# html-notes
Version1
1. Html templates for index and notes page was made.
2. Json data with notes was made.
3. Notes pages were filled with html generated from json with c# cli app. 
Problems:
1. Only notes html generation is automated, 
whole page should be output from cli app, based on json data.
2. Templates are not validated with html validator.
3. Poor template quality.
4. Poor json data format quality.
